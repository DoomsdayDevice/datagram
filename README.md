# Datagram
A [web app](https://doomsdaydevice.github.io/datagram/) made for the March Telegram competition. Primarily for mobile platforms.  

Features:  
    * No libraries, only native JS.  
    * you can move the slider and data will show on the screen (duh)  
    * nice transition animations  
    * crappy spaghetti code and bugs (the contest was one week long, so had to do it fast)
